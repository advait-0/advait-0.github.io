  <p>In these past few days I was working on the AudioTrack API for
  Android systems as well as the Core Audio API for Mac and iOS. Now
  most of the Apple ecosytem used to be coded in Objective-C (Swift in
  the last 10 years). So I started learning it. Objective C is like the
  quieter sibling who is not known by many. Both C++ and Objective-C
  were developed in 1980 as a superset to C language and add OOP(Object
  Oriented Programming) capabilites to it.</p>
  <h2 id="basics-of-objective-c">Basics of Objective-C</h2>
  <p>Objective-C uses a messaging syntax where objects send messages to
  classes to access its members. We generally utilize the Foundation
  framework developed by Apple which consist of the necessary classes we
  would generally utilize including but not limited to NSString, NSLog,
  NSDate etc. Here’s a fact, the NS is short for NeXTSTEP, the platform
  for which Foundation was originally conceived. It uses such prefix
  system as it does not have namespaces as C++.</p>
  <p>Messages are sent to objects using square brackets</p>
  <pre><code>[receiver message];
[receiver messageWithParameter:param];</code></pre>
  <p>In more conventional languages like C++, Java, or C#, the
  equivalent would be:</p>
  <p><code>receiver.message();</code></p>
  <p>Objective-C traditionally uses manual reference counting, but with
  Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), memory management is mostly
  automated.</p>
  <p>Methods in Objective-C can both return values and receive
  parameters. for example:</p>
  <p>In C++:</p>
  <pre><code>Method objc = new Method();
Date now = new Date();
receiver.doSomething(now, objc);</code></pre>
  <p>Objective-C might not seem intuitive if you’re coming from C++ but
  here’s how its code would look like.</p>
  <pre><code>Method* objc = [Method Method];
Date* now = [Date date];
[receiver doSomething:now with:objc];</code></pre>
  <p>The seemingly peculiar syntax of Objective-C becomes more intuitive
  when you consider it as a means of sending messages between
  objects.</p>
  <p>Here’s a quote from Brad Cox, the creator of Objective-C telling us
  about his conversation with Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Back in 1980 when both our languages were under construction, I
  came down and met with Bjarne Stroustrup. We had radically different
  views on how our languages would be designed. The key concept was the
  relative importance of machine efficiency vs programmer efficiency.
  Eventually, we agreed to disagree.<br />
  -Brad Cox (Interview for “The NeXT Bible” book)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you’re an intermediate C++ user this info should be enough for
  you to connect the dots of object oriented programming when starting
  out with Objective-C development, this obviously isn’t a full-fledged
  guide. I would suggest you to read this book by Aaron Hillegass and
  Mikey Ward, <a

  Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="what-am-i-currently-working-on">What am I currently working
  on?</h3>
  <p>My project is a bit experimental and research based so a lot of the
  time I’m investigating and studying the technology beneath. During my
  last update I was facing an error. The error was an internal Android
  error equivalent to the POSIX(Portable Operating System Interface)
  error ENOSYS “Function not implemented.” This indicates that the
  function called is not implemented at all, either in the C library
  itself or in the operating system. Changing the passthrough format
  from AAC_LC to PCM_16BIT seems to be fixing this error but we are
  still investigating as to why this needs to be done even when we are
  passing an undecoded stream to the output device.</p>
  <p>As a reference I’m looking at the implementations from the Android
  ExoPlayer and MPV Media player however even they don’t seem to support
  AAC passthrough over bluetooth A2DP but only over S/PDIF (Sony/Philips
  Digital Interface). I am studying the Android codebase and
  understanding how A2DP works to better understand this issue. I am
  also testing and using the debug logs generated by MPV and Spotify as
  a reference.</p>
  <p>I am also reading this book by Richard Boulanger and Victor
  Lazzarini, <a
  href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262014465/the-audio-programming-book/">The
  Audio Programming Book</a>. Its a great book to start off with digital
  audio programming.</p>

  <p>Huge Thanks to my mentor Thomas Guillem, I have passed my mid-term
  GSoC evaluation at the time of writing this blog. Hoping I can do well
  further too!</p>
  <p>Merci beaucoup,</p>
  <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
